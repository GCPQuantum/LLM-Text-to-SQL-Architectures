## Introduction

This repository provides a deep dive into the world of Text-to-SQL, specifically focusing on the integration of LLMs to enhance the SQL generation process. With the rise of LLMs, there's an increased potential to simplify and optimize the way we translate natural language into structured query language. This repository explores various architectural patterns that can be employed to harness the full potential of LLMs in this domain.

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern I
we use Using LLM to detect intent and recognize/extract entities followed by Text-to-SQL generation

### Pattern II
- **Description**: 

### Pattern III
- **Description**: 

### Pattern IV
- **Description**: 

### Pattern V
- **Description**: 


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures.git

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures

  <add instructutions to setup venv>

  source .venv/bin/activate

  pip install -r requireemnts.txt


Follow individual pattern READMEs for setup and usage instructions.
### Challenges and Limitations
A discussion on potential pitfalls, challenges, and areas of improvement in leveraging LLMs for Text-to-SQL.
