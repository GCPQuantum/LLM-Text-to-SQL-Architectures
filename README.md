## Introduction

This repository provides a deep dive into the world of Text-to-SQL, specifically focusing on the integration of LLMs to enhance the SQL generation process. With the rise of LLMs, there's an increased potential to simplify and optimize the way we translate natural language into structured query language. This repository explores various architectural patterns that can be employed to harness the full potential of LLMs in this domain.

## Architectural Patterns

### Modular Pipeline Architecture
- **Description**: A brief on how the modular pipeline enhances the Text-to-SQL process.
- **Implementation**: Code snippets, diagrams, and more.

### Feedback Loop Integration
... (similar structure for other patterns)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures.git

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd LLM-Text-to-SQL-Architectures


Follow individual pattern READMEs for setup and usage instructions.
### Challenges and Limitations
A discussion on potential pitfalls, challenges, and areas of improvement in leveraging LLMs for Text-to-SQL.
