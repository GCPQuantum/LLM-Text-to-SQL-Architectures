## Introduction üìò

This repository offers an in-depth exploration into Text-to-SQL conversion, emphasizing the role of LLMs in enhancing the SQL generation process. With the advent of LLMs, there is a promising opportunity to streamline the translation of natural language to SQL. We explore various architectural patterns that leverage the capabilities of LLMs in this exciting field.

## Architectural Patterns üèóÔ∏è

### Pattern I: Intent Detection and Entity Recognition with Text-to-SQL
Utilizing LLMs to identify intent, extract entities, and subsequently generate SQL.

### Pattern II: LLM Flow with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Incorporating Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) with table and column metadata to pinpoint relevant database schema elements, allowing LLMs to formulate queries based on natural language questions.

### Pattern III: Using SQL Agents
Adopting an autonomous agent-based approach where a BigQuery SQL agent, equipped with an ODBC connection, iteratively attempts and refines SQL queries with minimal external guidance.

### Pattern IV: Direct Schema Inference with Self-Correction
Implementing a self-correcting mechanism where the LLM receives direct schema input, generates an SQL query, and upon execution failure, uses the error feedback to self-correct and retry until successful. This pattern also explores using the Code-Chat Bison model to potentially reduce costs and improve latency.

### Pattern V: Direct Schema Inference, Self-Correction & Optimization
Similar to Pattern IV but employs a stochastic approach with a temperature setting of 1. It runs multiple trials and selects the query that executes the fastest.
