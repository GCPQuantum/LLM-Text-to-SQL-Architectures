## Introduction

This repository provides a deep dive into the world of Text-to-SQL, specifically focusing on the integration of LLMs to enhance the SQL generation process. With the rise of LLMs, there's an increased potential to simplify and optimize the way we translate natural language into structured query language. This repository explores various architectural patterns that can be employed to harness the full potential of LLMs in this domain.

## Architectural Patterns

### Modular Pipeline Architecture
- **Description**: A brief on how the modular pipeline enhances the Text-to-SQL process.
- **Implementation**: Code snippets, diagrams, and more.

### Feedback Loop Integration
